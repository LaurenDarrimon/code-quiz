## Description

On this page, play a Javascript-powered interactive coding quiz game. Each question is multiple choice. After you make your guess, you'll see if you got the last guestion right or wrong, the next question will appear, your score will update. If you get a question wrong, the timer will lose time - yikes! When you answer all the questions or the timer runs out is when the game is over. Once the game is over, you can record your scores and choose to play again.

## Methods 

### Javascript




### Object-Oriented Javascript
Early versions of this code quiz utilized a cascading serious of modular javascript functions. In subsequent code refactorings, the functions were transitioned into one code quiz object, with all the required functions converted into multiple object methods that make up the game. This object oriented javascript is cleaner and easier to follow. It also allows the entire code quiz to be a neatly contained object.

## Code

### Nested Object Methods:
The process of playing the game is built from linking together various other methods contained within the same self-referencing object, using the keyword "this."
